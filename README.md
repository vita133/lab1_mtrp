# Quadratic Equation Solver

## Description

This is a Kotlin program that solves quadratic equations. It can be used in both interactive and non-interactive modes.

In the interactive mode, the program prompts the user to enter the coefficients of a quadratic equation and displays the resulting equation along with its roots.

In the non-interactive mode, the program takes the coefficients as command line arguments and displays the roots.
